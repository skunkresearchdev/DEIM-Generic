| NaN | Risk assessment is the process of assessing all of the safety and environmental risks associated with each of the hazards identified during the hazard identification process. All safety and environmental aspects are identified and addressed through this risk assessment process. Each aspect is assessed based on the criteria set out in steps 1, 2 and 3 below and the inherent risk and significance level is determined. | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
